Very Late homework 3 (My Apologies)

The purpose of this assignment is to create an application that will randomly generate user passwords.

I initially tried a method that i ended up startting over with.

I was able to find a resource randojs.com that added the random function needed for the password field

Initially had trouble, as the page was initializing the prompt first and i was receiving and undefined error when click the button.

The purpose of this page is to randomly generate a password with the following requirements:

    8 - 128 characters
    At least 1 number
    At least 1 symbol
    At least 1 lower case letter
    At least 1 upper case letter

Upon clicking "Generate Password" User will be given a prompt asking for character length. If user selects >8 or <128, the prompt will ask for a valid number until that has been inputted.

User will then be prompted with a confirm for the character requirement and will be looped until they confirm 1 of each character.

Once all prompts/confirms have been successfully verified. A password will be generated and displayed. See Screenshots below.
